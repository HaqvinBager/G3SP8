REPLACE/UPDATE FILES:
Replace files to update the ones used in-game.
If they are simple, colorful and somewhat ugly; they are placeholders!
Go ahead and replace them.

SIZE OF SPRITE IS DIFFERENT:
If the size of the sprite is not the same as in the existing one update
the JSON file that uses the sprite found in: UI/JSON/. The sprite has the name
of the Canvas it is used in its name e.g: UI_MainMenu_StartGame_Idle.
e.g placeholder sprites are 128x64, higher resolution might be desired.
The value in the JSON to update is SPRITE SIZE X and SPRITE SIZE Y. 

I DON'T WANT TO DO A HOVER SPRITE :/
That's ok, use either the Idle or Click sprites for the hover:
Create a copy of either one and rename the copy SameNameAsTheOther_Hover.dds
